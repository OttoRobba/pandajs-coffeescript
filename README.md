pandajs-coffeescript
====================

Get your panda some caffeine! Assuming you have installed coffescript like this:

    npm install -g coffee-script
  
Clone this repo to your machine and then, from the command line, cd to the root directory and run:

    coffee -w --output src/game --compile src/coffee
  
This will continuously rebuild your game files into the game folder as you work on them. 

I like to couple this with [BrowserSync](http://invrse.co/development-with-browsersync/) for live development.

This also works fine with Panda Tool so you can build, compress and update if you have them installed (which you should!).

Have fun and make awesome games!
