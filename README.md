pandajs-coffeescript
====================

Get your panda some caffeine! Assuming you have installed coffescript like this:

    npm install -g coffe-script
  
Clone this repo to your machine and then, from the command line, cd to the root directory and run:

    coffee -w --output src/game --compile src/coffee
  
This will continuously rebuild your game files as you work on them. I like to couple it with [BrowserSync](http://invrse.co/development-with-browsersync/)

Have fun and make awesome games!
